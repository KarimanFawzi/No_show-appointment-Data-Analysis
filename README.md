# No_show-appointment-Data-Analysis
This project is a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.
No_show appointment data collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

In this project, I want to explore which factors have the most effect on appearing or not appearing on the specified appointment. I particulary want to explore those factors:

1- Gender, does the patients gender affect their appearence or not?

2- Scholarsip, does having a scholrship make it much probaple to attend the appointment or not?

3- Day of week, does apperance depend on whether it is a weekday or weekend?

4- Does having illness history affect patient apperance?
